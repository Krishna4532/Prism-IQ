Prism IQ: Behavioral Telemetry for Proactive PedagogyPrism IQ is an AI assessment framework that decodes the "how" of learning by capturing real-time "Digital Breadcrumbs" (click velocity, dwell time, friction) without intrusive sensors. It moves EdTech from reactive results to proactive process tracking.+4🛠️ Core TechnologyML Engine: Uses Unsupervised K-Means Clustering for real-time "Persona Discovery".+1$S_p$ Score: Calculates a Proactive Support Score to identify struggling students: $S_{p}=\frac{(w_{p}\cdot P)+(w_{h}\cdot H)}{A}$.XAI Logic: Translates data into human-readable "Teacher Nudges".+1👤 Student PersonasDeep Divers: High persistence/High accuracy; need challenges.+1Frustrated Fighters: High effort/Low accuracy; need scaffolding.+1Speed Runners: Fast completion/High accuracy; likely bored.+1Quiet Strugglers: High idle time/Zero attempts; risk of disengagement.📂 Structureapp.py: Streamlit Dashboard.src/: ML engine (ai_engine.py) and telemetry database (database.py).requirements.txt: Project dependencies.
